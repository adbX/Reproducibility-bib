Reproducibility Bibliography
----------------------------

This is a bibtex bibliography containing all references which the NCSA Reproducibility group have found which pertain to reproducibility in some way.

# Rules for contribution

1. Please find official bibtex citations from the published sources. If you cannot find such an official bibtex citation, then you can write you own.
2. Please use citation names which do not clash with other existing names. Search the bib before assigning your desired name to make sure.
3. Some services produce weird or complex citation names for their citations like '938492' or 'dio:blahblah-11328320'. In these cases, please select a better name for the citation like 'stodden-reproducibility-1995' or something like that containing an author name, year and subject.
4. DO NOT rename citations once they're in the file. Others use this file to handle citations in their work. If you rename a citation they are using, it will be difficult to find the new name of this citation.
